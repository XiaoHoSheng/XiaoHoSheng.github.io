        <p2>In spite of much research and conjecture, the origin of the Chinese people remains undetermined. We do not
          know who they were nor whence they came. Such evidence as there is points to their immigration from elsewhere;
          the Chinese themselves have a tradition of a Western origin. The first picture we have of their actual history
          shows us, not a people behaving as if long settled in a land which was their home and that of their
          forefathers, but an alien race fighting with wild beasts, clearing dense forests, and driving back the
          aboriginal inhabitants.
          <br />
          <br />
          Setting aside several theories (including the one that the Chinese are autochthonous and their civilization
          indigenous) now regarded by the best authorities as untenable, the researches of sinologists seem to indicate
          an origin (1) in early Akkadia; or (2) in Khotan, the Tarim valley (generally what is now known as Eastern
          Turkestan), or the K’un-lun Mountains (concerning which more presently). The second hypothesis may relate only
          to a sojourn of longer or shorter duration on the way from Akkadia to the ultimate settlement in China,
          especially since the Khotan civilization has been shown to have been imported from the Punjab in the third
          century B.C. The fact that serious mistakes have been made regarding the identifications of early Chinese
          rulers with Babylonian kings, and of the Chinese po-hsing (Cantonese bak-sing) ‘people’ with the Bak Sing or
          Bak tribes, does not exclude the possibility of an Akkadian origin. But in either case the immigration into
          China was probably Page 14gradual, and may have taken the route from Western or Central Asia direct to the
          banks of the Yellow River, or may possibly have followed that to the south-east through Burma and then to the
          north-east through what is now China—the settlement of the latter country having thus spread from south-west
          to north-east, or in a north-easterly direction along the Yangtzŭ River, and so north, instead of, as is
          generally supposed, from north to south.
          <br />
          <br />
          But this latter route would present many difficulties; it would seem to have been put forward merely as
          ancillary to the theory that the Chinese originated in the Indo-Chinese peninsula. This theory is based upon
          the assumptions that the ancient Chinese ideograms include representations of tropical animals and plants;
          that the oldest and purest forms of the language are found in the south; and that the Chinese and the
          Indo-Chinese groups of languages are both tonal. But all of these facts or alleged facts are as easily or
          better accounted for by the supposition that the Chinese arrived from the north or north-west in successive
          waves of migration, the later arrivals pushing the earlier farther and farther toward the south, so that the
          oldest and purest forms of Chinese would be found just where they are, the tonal languages of the Indo-Chinese
          peninsula being in that case regarded as the languages of the vanguard of the migration. Also, the ideograms
          referred to represent animals and plants of the temperate zone rather than of the tropics, but even if it
          could be shown, which it cannot, that these animals and plants now belong exclusively to the tropics, that
          would be no proof of the tropical origin of the Chinese, for in the earliest times the climate of North China
          was Page 15much milder than it is now, and animals such as tigers and elephants existed in the dense jungles
          which are later found only in
          <br />
          <br />
          The theory of a southern origin (to which a further serious objection will be stated presently) implies a
          gradual infiltration of Chinese immigrants through South or Mid-China (as above indicated) toward the north,
          but there is little doubt that the movement of the races has been from north to south and not vice versa. In
          what are now the provinces of Western Kansu and Ssŭch’uan there lived a people related to the Chinese (as
          proved by the study of Indo-Chinese comparative philology) who moved into the present territory of Tibet and
          are known as Tibetans; in what is now the province of Yünnan were the Shan or Ai-lao (modern Laos), who,
          forced by Mongol invasions, emigrated to the peninsula in the south and became the Siamese; and in Indo-China,
          not related to the Chinese, were the Annamese, Khmer, Mon, Khasi, Colarains (whose remnants are dispersed over
          the hill tracts of Central India), and other tribes, extending in prehistoric times into Southern China, but
          subsequently driven back by the expansion of the Chinese in that direction.
          <br />
          <br />
          Taking into consideration all the existing evidence, the objections to all other theories of the origin of the
          Chinese seem to be greater than any yet raised to the theory that immigrants from the Tarim valley or beyond
          (i.e. from Elam or Akkadia, either direct or via Eastern Turkestan) struck the banks of the Yellow River in
          their eastward journey and followed its course until they Page 16reached the localities where we first find
          them settled, namely, in the region covered by parts of the three modern provinces of Shansi, Shensi, and
          Honan where their frontiers join. They were then (about 2500 or 3000 B.C.) in a relatively advanced state of
          civilization. The country east and south of this district was inhabited by aboriginal tribes, with whom the
          Chinese fought, as they did with the wild animals and the dense vegetation, but with whom they also commingled
          and intermarried, and among whom they planted colonies as centres from which to spread their civilization.
