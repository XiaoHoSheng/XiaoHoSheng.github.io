          <h1 class="docTitle">On Chinese Mythology</h1>
          <p2>

            <p2>The Manichæst, yin-yang (dualist), idea of existence, to which further reference will be made in the next chapter, finds its illustration in the dual life, real and imaginary, of all the peoples of the earth. They have both real histories and mythological histories. In the preceding chapter I have dealt briefly with the first—the life of reality—in China from the earliest times to the present day; the succeeding chapters are concerned with the second—the life of imagination. A survey of the first was necessary for a complete understanding of the second. The two react upon each other, affecting the national character and through it the history of the world.
              <br />
              <br />
              The sobriety and accuracy of Chinese historians is proverbial. I have dilated upon this in another work, and need add here only what I inadvertently omitted there—a point hitherto unnoticed or at least unremarked—that the very word for history in Chinese (shih) means impartiality or an impartial annalist. It has been said that where there is much myth there is little history, and vice versa, and though this may not be universally true, undoubtedly the persistently truthful recording of facts, events, and sayings, even at the risk of loss, yea, and actual loss of life of the historian as the result of his refusal to make false entries in his chronicle at the bidding of the emperor (as in the case of the historiographers of Ch’i in 547 B.C.), indicates a type of mind which would require some very strong stimulus to cause it to soar very far into the hazy realms of fanciful imagination.
              <br />
              <br />
              In order that there may be myth, three further conditions must be fulfilled. There must, as we have seen, be constructive imagination, but, nevertheless, there must not be too much of it. As stated above, mythology, or rather myth, is the unscientific man’s explanation. If the constructive imagination is so great that it becomes self-critical, if the story-teller doubts his own story, if, in short, his mind is scientific enough to see that his explanation Page 65is no explanation at all, then there can be no myth properly so called. As in religion, unless the myth-maker believes in his myth with all his heart and soul and strength, and each new disciple, as it is cared for and grows under his hands during the course of years, holds that he must put his shoes from off his feet because the place whereon he treads is holy ground, the faith will not be propagated, for it will lack the vital spark which alone can make it a living thing.
              <br />
              <br />
              The theory of a southern origin (to which a further serious objection will be stated presently) implies a
              gradual infiltration of Chinese immigrants through South or Mid-China (as above indicated) toward the north,
              but there is little doubt that the movement of the races has been from north to south and not vice versa. In
              what are now the provinces of Western Kansu and Ssŭch’uan there lived a people related to the Chinese (as
              proved by the study of Indo-Chinese comparative philology) who moved into the present territory of Tibet and
              are known as Tibetans; in what is now the province of Yünnan were the Shan or Ai-lao (modern Laos), who,
              forced by Mongol invasions, emigrated to the peninsula in the south and became the Siamese; and in Indo-China,
              not related to the Chinese, were the Annamese, Khmer, Mon, Khasi, Colarains (whose remnants are dispersed over
              the hill tracts of Central India), and other tribes, extending in prehistoric times into Southern China, but
              subsequently driven back by the expansion of the Chinese in that direction.
              <br />
              <br />
              The soul in China is everywhere in evidence, and if myths have “first and foremost to do with the life of the soul” it would appear strange that the Chinese, Page 71having spiritualized everything from a stone to the sky, have not been creative of myth. Why they have not the foregoing considerations show us clearly enough. We must take them and their myths as we find them. Let us, then, note briefly the result of their mental workings as reacted on by their environment.
