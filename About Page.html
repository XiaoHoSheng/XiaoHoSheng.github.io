                    Werner arrived in Peking in the 1880s attached to the British Legation as a student interpreter. Werner remained in the British consular service in China until 1914 serving in postings including time working in the Chancery at the Peking Legation, then a year in Canton (Guangzhou), two in Tientsin (Tianjin) and another couple in Macao. He later spent a year in Hangchow (Hangzhou), one in the Pagoda Anchorage (Mawei), a year in the isolated Kiungchow (Qiongshan) on Hainan Island in 1900,[1] a couple of years on the Gulf of Tonkin in the remote posting of Pakhoi (Beihai) before being posted to Kongmoon (Jiangmen). Promotion saw Werner Consul at the busy tea port of Kiukiang (Jiujiang), serving for four years. In 1911 Werner became British Consul-General in Foochow (Fuzhou). He left the consular service in 1914.
